Robots with no active weapons are a good options for newcomers to the sport as they are less complex.

                            <p>A meltybrain (or  just melty for short) is a type of thwackbot that is able to spin while moving. It does this by using a combination of sensors and code to detect where it is in the arena, convert control inputs into a direction, and then perform tiny adjustments to the speed of the motors while spinning to produce an overall force in that direction. Meltybrains are generally permitted under active weapon rules.</p>
                            <p>The system gets its name as trying to understand and write code for it will melt your brain. An earlier version of the system was dubbed "Tornado Drive".</p>
                            <p>While many early meltybrains were built like a traditional thwackbot, modern ones tend to more closely resemble <a href="#Shell Spinner">shell spinners.</a></p>

            <h2 id="Spinner">Spinners</h2>
            <p>A spinner can be thought of as a <a href="#Axe">hammer</a> that is being swung in a full circle. With each rotation the spinner can gain speed until it is moving incredibly fast. The common tip-speed limit for weapons is 250mph (400km/h). Spinners mainly consist of either a bar or a disc. Unlike <a href="#Saw">saws,</a> spinners are trying to deliver kinetic energy so a spinning disc will generally have one or two teeth to get a good bite into an opponent.</p>

                        <p>Horizontal spinners have their weapon aligned horizontally or parallel to floor. Upsides of this include being able to mount a larger weapon more easily and using the space the weapon takes up as a danger zone that cannot be attacked for fear of damage. Horizontals however tend to have a lot of recoil and can be easier to smother than other types of spinner.</p>
                        <p>Robots on this site referred to simply as "Horizontal Spinner" are typically offset horizontals where the weapon is in front of the robot. Configuring a robot this way means it can be made invertible easily and can allow for swing attacks, where you spin the front end into an opponent as they approach and catch them in the side. Any other types of horizontal spinner that do not fall into the below categories will also get this label.</p>

                            <p>Overhead horizontal spinners are mounted to the top of a robot's chassis near the centre. Doing this allows a robot to have a 360-degree angle of attack meaning as long as the weapon is spinning, the opponent must face taking damage to get close. The weapon covering the whole robot does mean it can be more easily smothered than an offset horizontal.</p>
                            <p>Some overhead spinners, like <a href="/robot/son-of-whyachi">Son of Whyachi,</a> have a bent or angled bar allowing them to hit lower down. When more than 2 of these arms are used, they can be reinforced with cross-braces between them. This style of overhead spinner can be referred to as a "Cage Spinner".

                            <p>The best offence is defence and the best defence is offence. A shell spinner allows your armour to be your weapon by spinning the entire outer shell of the robot. The shell is mounted in the same way as an overhead spinner, but unlike an overhead you cannot hit the chassis of most shells if the weapon is down. Shells have extremely heavy weapons and take longer to get up to speed than other types of spinner and can be particularly unstable driving while doing so, but when they hit, they hit extremely hard. Shell spinners require a direction indicator which is usually done in the form of a bent pole (which also allows self-righting) or by lights under the robot.</p>
                            <p>Primarily shell spinners, but other types that cover part of the chassis and have a 360-degree attack can be referred to as "Full-Body Spinners".

Since the internals of the robot must be inside the spinning ring, it cannot be connected to a central shaft and must be supported by a series of bearings around the outer body.

                        <p>Vertical spinners are placed vertically or at a right angle to the ground. Vertical spinners have an advantage over <a href="#Horizontal Spinner">horizontals</a> in that they are braced against the ground. This means that when they hit, they do not get spun away and instead can deliver more energy. The hits they make also knock the opponent up and forward, making it easier to get follow-up hits and in some cases even juggle the opponent.</p>
                        <p>On the other hand, vertical spinners have issues with gyroscopic forces. When a heavy object rotates at high speed, it wants to remain aligned with the 2D plane on which they spin. For <a href="#Horizontal Spinner">horizontal spinners</a> this is not a problem, but for verts, as they try to turn they twist the weapon out of its plane of rotation causing it to fight back and pull one of the wheels off the ground.</p>
                        <p>A robot referred to on this site as simply "vertical spinner" is typically just a single bar or disc, but to get a wider area of attack, two can be mounted on a wide hub at a distance apart.</p>

                    <p>Axe weapons are a weight on a stick being swung overhead to attack an opponent. They may have a large and flat-ended head to try and shake loose internal components, or a sharp-ended head to attempt to peirce armour and hit those components directly. Axes have an advantage in that most other weapon types target the front and side armour of a robot, so top armour tends to be thinner. Some invertible robots also find it difficult to add extra top armour as they need clearance for the wheels. Modern axes tend to make heavy use of magnets to avoid jumping when the weapon is swung.</p>
                    <p>This site classifies all weapons that fit the above description as axes, even if either by looks or thematically they could be called hammers. Both axes and hammers use the same mechanism, and can be swapped between each other by switching just the head. Using a unified name makes searching for robots with this weapon type easier, and axe was the name chosen.</p>

First of all they negate the thin armour advantage that a regular axe has by attacking the thicker side of the opponent. Secondly, when they do hit, the opponent is not braced against the floor, which could cause them to get knocked away. This means most horizontal axe robots tend to mount one on each side with all the negative aspects that having two weapons brings. The limited range of motion also means they have a limited time to build speed compared to a <a href="#Spinner">spinner</a> and will cause less damage, so for the type of attacks they are trying to make, a <a href="#Horizontal Spinner">horizontal spinner</a> will deliver them more effectively.</p>

                        <p>Regular axes suffer from the problem that they have at most half a rotation to build energy before hitting an opponent. As with horizontal axes, a <a href="#Spinner">spinner</a> would deal more damage, but it is not as obvious how to build a spinner that would attack in a similar way to a regular axe compared to a horizontal one. This is where the hammersaw comes in.</p>
                        <p>A hammersaw is a downward spinning <a href="Vertical Spinner">vertical spinner</a> mounted on a moving arm. The term "hammersaw" was coined by the Sawblaze team to show that their spinning weapon and <a href="Saw">saw</a> were interchangeable, however it is important to note that a hammersaw is not a saw and uses kinetic energy to damage opponents. Hammersaws may have less power in the swing than a regular axe, but the spinning blade more than makes up for that. The combination of spin and swing allows these weapons to get good engagement when they land, cutting holes in top armour and hitting internals much more regularly than axes. On the other hand, they have issues with gyroscopic forces, and the slower swing means they often need to pin opponents to land a meaningful hit.</p>

This may be just one side of the opponent to tip it over, or picking it up entirely and holding it midair. With a good lift on an opponent it is then easier for a lifter to push the opponent where they want them to go.</p>
                        <p>There can be a grey line between a <a href="#Flipper">flipper</a> and a lifter. The methodology used by this site is that if a weapon was to "fire" from the down position to the up position, (assuming the up position is below vertical and there is a good grip on the opponent and it doesn't fall off the weapon arm) would the opponent end up sitting on the weapon arm, or pushed away from the robot. If it is still in contact, the weapon is a lifter if not, a flipper.</p>
                        <p>That being said, there are many robots on this site that do not have video to show that behaviour, so they will be listed as described by their sources.</p>

                        <p>A flipper is a weapon designed to throw the opponent into the air. Usually achieved with a pneumatic ram, this weapon type allows a robot to try and throw an opponent so high that damage is done on the way down, throw them over a wall, or force them to keep self-righting and reorienting themselves, unable to get a clean attack in.</p>
                        <p>Flippers are classified by where the hinge is located related to the flipping arm. The most common type of flipper has the part of the arm that lifts up at the front of the robot on the ground. If you follow the arm to the other end to where it attaches, you'll find the hinge at the rear of the arm/robot, so this is called a "Rear-Hinged Flipper".</p>
                        <p>There are many types of flippers, but the ones referred to simply as "Flippers" are rear-hinges and any that do not fall into the categories below.</p>

            <h2>Abrasive Weapons</h2>
            <p>Abrasive weapons aim to cut into the opponent. Using sharp blades and tiny teeth, an abrasive weapon will cut a hole in an opponent when applied to them with pressure. The main drawback of abrasive weapons is that they require high pressure to be applied to a single spot on a robot for an extended period of time. This means to get a good amount of damage done these robots will need to pin their opponents in place. Abrasive weapons also have difficulty cutting through particularly hard materials, and can be gummed up by certain soft ones.</p>

Many early robots were armed with spears in an attempt to peirce opponents armour, but as armour got stronger spears had a major flaw. A robot armed with a spear is not braced against anything in combat, so when their opponent is hit, they get pushed backwards with an equal amount of force to that given to the opponent. This minimises the damage done.</p>
